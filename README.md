# covid-19-display
Display COVID-19 data for various regions within Canada.

## Data Source

> Yes, this project could have gotten the data directly from the sources, but I wanted to play around with some Kubernetes stuff and this is my lazy way of getting data.

For this project, the data is retrived from the [COVID-19 Tracker Canada](https://api.covid19tracker.ca/docs/1.0/overview) project.
